This program is created for PAC-SLI measurement setup in ISOLDE, CERN. This program is created for research use and should not be used in commercial applications.

This program is designed to be operated with Arduino Mega2560 I/O-board.  Communication between Arduino and this LabVIEW program uses serial communication over USB. MakerHub LINX library is used. https://www.labviewmakerhub.com/doku.php?id=libraries:linx:start


In monitoring tab user can monitor input and output values. Monitoring tab has also the control of detector data acquisition control. 

Settings tab contains all essential settings for running the measurement automation. There user can control I/O-ports, SPI settings and automation operation order and timing. SPI is used to read temperature values from MAX31855KASA+ thermocouple amplifier-adc. SPI MISO and CLK ports are fixed due Arduino design and stated under SPI-settings.

     I/O type.....................I/O-port
     -MISO/DO/Data.......50
     -CLK/Clock...............52

Furnace power setting I/O-port must be digital I/O-port with PMW. Choose of digital ports 2-13 (Arduino Mega). 

Indicator next to device name is ON when link between PC and Arduino is established and ready to run. Spress Start-button to run.

CAUTION! FURNACE MUST BE IN UP POSITION, OTHERWISE FURNACE WILL BREAK DURING RUN.

If program does not run normally or you press "Abort Execution" of LabVIEW, build firmware to Arduino again. It is good practice to build firmware before
every run start. One can build firmware in LabVIEW going 

    Tools >> MakerHUB >> LINX >> LINX Firmware Wizard...  

and there choosing right I/O-board and communication channel. In case of firmware not installing properly, disconnect all wires from Arduino, go to Arduino 
IDE and build in empty Sketch. If that does uploads properly, you can proceed to build LINX firmware.
