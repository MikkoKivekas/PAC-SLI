This program is created for PAC-SLI measurement setup in ISOLDE, CERN. This program is created for research use and should not be used in commercial applications.

This program is designed to be operated with Arduino Mega2560 I/O-board.  Communication between Arduino and this LabVIEW program uses serial communication over USB. MakerHub LINX library is used. https://www.labviewmakerhub.com/doku.php?id=libraries:linx:start


In monitoring tab user can monitor input and output values. Monitoring tab has also the control of detector data acquisition control. 

Settings tab contains all essential settings for running the measurement automation. There user can control I/O-ports, SPI settings and automation operation order and timing. SPI is used to read temperature values from MAX31855KASA+ thermocouple amplifier-adc. SPI MISO and CLK ports are fixed due Arduino design and stated under SPI-settings.

     I/O type.....................I/O-port
     -MISO/DO/Data.......50
     -CLK/Clock...............52

Furnace power setting I/O-port must be digital I/O-port with PMW. Choose of digital ports 2-13 (Arduino Mega). 

Indicator next to device name is ON when link between PC and Arduino is established and ready to run. Spress Start-button to run.

CAUTION! FURNACE MUST BE IN UP POSITION, OTHERWISE FURNACE WILL BREAK DURING RUN.

If program does not run normally or you press "Abort Execution" of LabVIEW, build firmware to Arduino again. It is good practice to build firmware before
every run start. One can build firmware in LabVIEW going 

    Tools >> MakerHUB >> LINX >> LINX Firmware Wizard...  

and there choosing right I/O-board and communication channel. In case of firmware not installing properly, disconnect all wires from Arduino, go to Arduino 
IDE and build in empty Sketch. If that does uploads properly, you can proceed to build LINX firmware.

You can find VIs and other information from https://github.com/MikkoKivekas/PAC-SLI


This program uses custom LINX firmware. Customization is adding code below to end of setup block of Arduino Sketch.

     //Setting PWM pins 9 and 10 PWM frequency to 30.64 Hz for Multicomp SSR
     TCCR2B = TCCR2B & 0b11111000 | 0x07; // for PWM frequency of 30.64 Hz 0x07 is the right setting.
  
     //This frequency setting is for using Multicomp SSR, that cannot input too high frequency without cutting the usable scale.
     //With, lowest possible, ~30 Hz frequency (setting 0x07 for timer 2) almost full scale is usable, percentages balow 10% are not usable
     //Setting 0x06 cuts out about 50% marker.

     * Arduino Mega has different pins on timers than Uno in link. Mega timers
     timer 0 (controls pin 13, 4);
     timer 1 (controls pin 12, 11);
     timer 2 (controls pin 10, 9);
     timer 3 (controls pin 5, 3, 2);
     timer 4 (controls pin 8, 7, 6);
     */
     
Custom firmware must be uploaded through Arduino IDE. In Firmware Wizard choode right Arduino Board (Mega 2560) and right COM-port.
After that choose "Build with Arduino IDE", choose right path for Arduino IDE file. Arduino file that need to be modified can usually be found
from path 
     C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2017\vi.lib\MakerHub\LINX\Firmware\Source\libraries\LINX\examples\Arduino_Mega2560_Serial

This customization lowers PWM frequency of pins 9 and 10 to 30.64 Hz. This frequency is used, because in original setup we use SSR that cannot input correctly higher frequencies.
Setup uses Multicomp 20A60VDC SSR with 3-5V input.
